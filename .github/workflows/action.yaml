    # 🔑 CORRECT PLACEMENT AND SCOPE FOR THE GITHUB_TOKEN
    # Permissions MUST be defined at the job level. 
    # Read access is sufficient for checking links.
    # Write access is only needed if the job modifies the repo (e.g., creates a commit/issue/PR status).
    permissions:
      contents: read       # Only needs read access to check the files
      pull-requests: write # Recommended if the action updates PR status/checks
      issues: write        # Recommended if the action creates failure issues
